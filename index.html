    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Dropkick Murphys are an American Celtic punk band formed in Quincy, Massachusetts in 1996. Singer and bassist
        Ken Casey has been the band's only constant member. Other current members include drummer Matt Kelly (1997– ),
        singer Al Barr (1998– ), guitarist James Lynch (2000– ), multi-instrumentalist Tim Brennan (2003– ) and
        multi-instrumentalist Jeff DaRosa (2007– ).</p>

    <p>The band was initially signed to independent punk record label Hellcat Records, releasing five albums for the
        label, and building a reputation locally through constant touring and yearly St. Patrick's Day week shows, held
        in and around Boston. The 2004 single, "Tessie" became the band's first mainstream hit and one of their biggest
        charting singles to date.</p>

    <p>The band's final Hellcat release, 2005's The Warrior's Code, included the song "I'm Shipping Up to Boston." The
        song was featured in the 2006 film The Departed, and went on to become the band's only platinum-selling single
        to date. It remains one of their best-known songs. The band is known for their loud, energetic live shows.</p>

    <p>In 2007, the band began releasing music through their own imprint label, Born & Bred via Alternative Distribution
        Alliance. 2007's The Meanest of Times made its debut at No. 20 on the Billboard charts and featured the
        successful single, "The State of Massachusetts", while 2011's Going Out in Style was an even bigger success,
        making its debut at No. 6, giving the band their highest-charting album to date. The band's eighth studio
        album, Signed and Sealed in Blood was released in 2013 making its debut at No. 9 on the Billboard charts and
        featured the single "The Season's Upon Us", a Christmas song that was one of the band's highest charting
        singles, and the single, "Rose Tattoo" which has become one of their most popular songs. The band's ninth
        album, 11 Short Stories of Pain & Glory, which was released on January 6, 2017, debuted at number 8 on the
        Billboard charts and rose to number 2 on the charts. Their tenth album, Turn Up That Dial, was released on
        April 30, 2021.</p>
